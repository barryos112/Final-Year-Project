# Final-Year-Project

This was a year long college project that accounted for 20 credits for my final year in Computer Science and Business. 

I made a prototype full stack web application to investigate fantasy sports users interest in innovative new forms of fantasy sports. 

I built the website using React.JS and I have included a video below showing its full functionality
